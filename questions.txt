1. WTF is that?? what's the point?

int fuckit(3);
int emus{7};
int rheas = {12};

int rocs = {};
int psychics{};

2. Does c++ throw an exception in case of variable overflow? (it does not)
uint wtf = UINT_MAX + 1; 
2.1 Does max value depend on pc architecture? 

3. Character types. Char, wchar_t. When to use which? Always wchar_t?
UTF-8, UTF-16, UTF-16LE, UTF-16BE? Windows? wtf?
char_t16 vs char_t32? 
a: wchar_t is UTF16LE which is used by win32API and was invented before utf8

4. Define used to replace variable during preprocessing. Const? Is it the same?

5. Floating. Only three? float, double, long double?
Where is decimal? Double has relatvie accuracy, so how to work with money?

6. How to set compile options in the file? Like Makefile for C
